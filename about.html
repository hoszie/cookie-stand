            My name is Pat and I'm an alright bloke with a babe wife and a couple kids. One is mine, don't know where the other one came from to be honest. I don't allow myself to think about it. I live in constant denial and to cope I put all my love that I should have for my kid into rather pretentious novelty food. I feel like part of me is missing. I haven't slept in years. And milk, we like milk a lot.

            This is some of the dope shit I make in my kitchen. Notice all the love I put into this inanimate object instead of into another human being in my house. We haven't made eye contact since she started talking.            </figcaption>
